2. **Bookmark Frequently Accessed Pages**

   - Consider browser extensions for quick access

3. **Use Global Search Liberally**

   - Recent searches saved for quick re-access

4. **Keep Multiple Tabs Open**
   - Open detail pages in new tabs (Cmd/Ctrl + Click)
   - Keep reference data in background tabs
   - Use browser tab groups to organize by module

5. **Customize Dashboard Widgets**
   - Pin most-used widgets to top
   - Hide widgets you don't need

   - Consistent UI reduces learning curve

### Time-Saving Techniques

## FAQ

**Q: Can I customize the sidebar module order?**

A: Not currently. Module order is determined by typical workflow progression. However, you can use bookmarks or browser favorites for custom ordering.

**Q: How do I hide modules I don't use?**

A: Module visibility is determined by your role and permissions. Contact your administrator to adjust your role if certain modules shouldn't be visible.

**Q: Can I change the dashboard shown on login?**

A: Yes. Navigate to your desired default dashboard, then go to User Menu > Settings > Preferences and set "Default Dashboard on Login".

**Q: What's the difference between Cmd+K search and module search bars?**

A: Cmd+K searches across all modules globally. Module search bars only search within the current module. Use Cmd+K when you're not sure which module contains the record.

**Q: How do I navigate between multiple workspaces?**

A: If you have access to multiple workspaces (uncommon), use User Menu > Switch Workspace. Most users only have one workspace.
