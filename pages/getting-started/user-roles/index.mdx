## Multi-Tenancy

The RBAC system supports multi-tenancy for organizations with multiple business units:

- Users can have different roles in different tenants
- Permissions are isolated between tenants
- Cross-tenant access requires explicit permissions
- Administrators can manage tenant-specific roles

## Role Assignment

### For Employees

1. Administrators assign roles during user creation
2. Users can have multiple roles simultaneously
3. Effective permissions are the union of all assigned roles
4. Role changes take effect immediately

### For Portal Users

1. Administrators approve portal access requests
2. Portal type determines base permissions
3. Administrators can customize allowed modules
4. Changes take effect on next login

## Viewing Your Permissions

To see your current roles and permissions:

1. Click your profile icon in the top-right
2. Select "Profile" or "Account Settings"
3. View your assigned roles in the "Roles & Permissions" section
4. Contact your administrator to request additional permissions

## Need Different Access?

If you need access to additional features or modules:

1. Contact your system administrator
2. Explain which features you need and why
3. Your administrator will review and update your permissions
4. You may need manager approval for certain elevated permissions

## Security Notes

- Roles and permissions are audited for compliance
- Permission changes are logged
- Administrators regularly review access levels
- Unused accounts are automatically deactivated
- Follow the principle of least privilege
