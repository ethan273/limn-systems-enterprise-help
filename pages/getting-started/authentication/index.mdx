# Authentication

Learn how to access the Limn Systems Enterprise platform and manage your account.

## Logging In

### Employee Login (Google SSO)

Internal employees use Google Workspace Single Sign-On:

1. Navigate to the Limn Systems Enterprise login page
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Select your Limn Systems Google Workspace account
4. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to your dashboard

**Note:** Only authorized Google Workspace accounts can access the system.

### External Portal Login (Magic Links)

Customers, designers, factory partners, and QC teams use magic link authentication:

1. You'll receive an email invitation when your account is approved
2. Click the "Access Portal" link in the email
3. This one-time link will log you in automatically
4. Your session will remain active based on your portal type

**Portal Types:**
- **Customer Portal** - Order tracking and project visibility
- **Designer Portal** - Project collaboration and deliverable submission
- **Factory Portal** - Production management and quality reporting
- **QC Portal** - Quality inspection and reporting

## Session Management

### Session Duration

Your login session duration depends on your user type:

- **Employees (SSO)** - 30 days (configurable by admin)
- **External Portals** - Varies by portal type and admin settings

### Staying Logged In

- Your session is automatically maintained while you're active
- If you close the browser, you may need to log in again depending on settings
- Sessions expire after a period of inactivity for security

## Security Features

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

For enhanced security, administrators can enable 2FA:

- Managed through your Google Workspace account (for employees)
- Portal users follow email-based verification

### Password Management

- **Employees** - Passwords are managed through Google Workspace
- **Portal Users** - Magic link system eliminates the need for passwords

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Log In with Google

If you're having trouble with Google SSO:

1. Ensure you're using your Limn Systems Google Workspace account
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies
3. Try using an incognito/private browsing window
4. Contact your IT administrator if issues persist

### Magic Link Not Working

If your portal access link isn't working:

1. Check that you're using the most recent email invitation
2. Verify the link hasn't expired (links are time-limited)
3. Request a new magic link from your administrator
4. Ensure you're clicking the link from the same device/browser

### Session Expired

If your session expires:

1. **Employees** - Simply log in again with Google SSO
2. **Portal Users** - Request a new magic link from your administrator

## Account Management
