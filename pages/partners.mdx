# Partner Management

## Overview

The Partner Management system provides comprehensive tools for managing relationships with external manufacturers, designers, sourcing agents, and other business partners throughout the product lifecycle. This integrated platform enables you to track partner capabilities, manage portal access, monitor performance metrics, coordinate communication, and maintain document compliance—all within a single unified interface.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Multi-Type Partner Support**: Manage three distinct partner types (factories, designers, sourcing agents) with specialized workflows, portal modules, and performance tracking tailored to each partner's role in the production ecosystem.

- **Comprehensive Contact Management**: Maintain unlimited contacts per partner with role-based flags (primary, QC, production, finance), employment tracking, department assignments, and employee lifecycle management from onboarding through termination.

- **Performance Analytics**: Track 12-month rolling metrics including orders completed, on-time delivery rates (0-100%), defect rates (0-100%), total revenue, and quality ratings (0-5 scale) with automated statistical aggregation and trend analysis.

- **Secure Portal Access**: Grant role-based portal access to partner contacts with granular module-level permissions (7 modules for factories, 5 for designers, 6 for sourcing), automatic email notifications, and instant session invalidation upon revocation.

- **Document Compliance Tracking**: Upload and track contracts, certifications, insurance policies, and technical specifications with issue dates, expiry dates, renewal reminders, and status management (active, archived, expired).

- **Capacity Planning**: Define production capacity (max units/month), lead time expectations (standard days), and minimum order requirements to prevent over-assignment, optimize workload distribution, and ensure realistic production scheduling.

- **Financial Integration**: Configure payment terms, currency preferences (default USD), and track revenue generation with integration to production invoicing for seamless financial operations and vendor management reporting.

- **Production System Integration**: Partners are directly linked to production orders with active order counts, assignment validation, deletion protection for partners with active work, and automated partner selection dropdowns based on status and type filtering.

## Managing Partners

### Creating Partners

Add partners through type-specific forms with required fields: company_name, primary_contact, primary_email. Configure capacity metrics, specializations, certifications, and payment terms.

### Manufacturer Capabilities & Specializations

**Location:** Partners > Factories > [Factory Name] > Capabilities & Specializations section

Factory partners support four editable capability arrays that define their manufacturing expertise, certifications, and communication capabilities. These fields use inline tag-based editing for easy management.

**Specializations** (Array of Strings)

Manufacturing specializations and primary production methods.

**Common Specializations:**
- Woodworking (furniture, cabinetry, joinery)
- Metalworking (welding, fabrication, machining)
- Upholstery (fabric, leather, foam work)
- Glass Fabrication (cutting, edging, tempering)
- Ceramic Production (slip casting, glazing, firing)
- Custom Fabrication (mixed materials, unique processes)

**Usage:** Helps match factories to appropriate production orders based on required manufacturing processes.

**Capabilities** (Array of Strings)

Specific technical capabilities and equipment available at the factory.

**Common Capabilities:**
- CNC Machining (3-axis, 5-axis)
- Powder Coating (color matching, finish quality)
- Welding (MIG, TIG, spot welding)
- Laser Cutting (wood, metal, acrylic)
- 3D Printing (prototyping, small batch production)
- Hand Finishing (sanding, staining, polishing)
- Assembly & Packaging (kitting, custom packaging)
- Rush Production (expedited turnaround capability)

**Usage:** Enables granular filtering when selecting factories for complex production requirements.

**Certifications** (Array of Strings)

Quality certifications, compliance standards, and industry accreditations.

**Common Certifications:**
- ISO 9001 (Quality Management System)
- FSC Certified (sustainable wood sourcing)
- CARB Compliant (California Air Resources Board - formaldehyde emissions)
- GREENGUARD (low chemical emissions)
- OSHA Compliant (workplace safety)
- ISO 14001 (Environmental Management)
- SA8000 (Social Accountability - labor standards)
- BIFMA (Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association)

**Usage:** Ensures factories meet client requirements for regulatory compliance and quality standards.

**Languages** (Array of Strings)

Languages spoken by factory staff for communication with design/production teams.

**Common Languages:**
- English
- Mandarin (China)
- Cantonese (Hong Kong, Guangdong)
- Spanish
- Vietnamese
- Italian
- German

**Usage:** Facilitates effective communication, reduces misunderstandings, and improves production coordination.

**Editing Capabilities Fields:**

1. Navigate to Partners > Factories > [Factory Name]
2. Scroll to "Capabilities & Specializations" card
3. Click "Edit" button to enable inline editing mode
4. Add items: Type value, press Enter or click "Add" button
5. Remove items: Click X icon next to each tag
6. Save changes: Click "Save" button or Cancel to discard
7. Changes sync immediately to database

**Best Practices:**

- **Be Specific:** Use detailed capability names ("5-Axis CNC Machining" not just "CNC")
- **Standardize Terms:** Use consistent naming across all factories for easier filtering
- **Keep Current:** Update capabilities when factory adds new equipment
- **Compliance First:** Always verify certifications before adding (request documentation)
- **Language Proficiency:** Only list languages with fluent staff members
- **Remove Outdated:** Delete expired certifications or discontinued capabilities

**Use Cases:**

**Automated Factory Matching:** System can automatically suggest factories based on product requirements:
```
Product requires: CNC Machining, FSC Certified, Mandarin-speaking
System filters to: Factories with all three capabilities
```

**Compliance Reporting:** Export factories by certification for client audits or RFP responses.

**Capacity Planning:** Identify factories with rush production capability for urgent orders.

**Communication Efficiency:** Route design questions to factories with appropriate language capabilities.

### Partner Status

- **Active**: Operational partner accepting work
- **Inactive**: Archived partner preserving historical data
- **Pending Approval**: New partner awaiting vetting
- **Suspended**: Temporarily suspended for quality/compliance issues

### Deleting Partners

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot Delete Partner**: Partner has active production orders. Complete or reassign orders first.

**Portal Access Not Working**: Verify portal_access_enabled = true, user_id is set, modules_allowed is not empty.

**Contact Not Receiving Email**: Check email address, verify Resend API configured, check spam folder.

**Performance Stats Missing**: Ensure partner_performance records exist, verify time range, check completed orders.

**Search Not Finding Partner**: Verify search term, check status filter, ensure partner exists.

---

## Tips & Tricks

- Use "pending_approval" status for vetting new partners
- Tag partners with "rush-capable" for urgent orders
- Set is_primary flag on main contact for notifications
- Monitor defect_rate trends to identify quality issues early
- Track actual lead times and update estimates
- Use specializations array for automated partner matching
- Review performance stats before contract renewals
- Set realistic minimum_order to balance profitability and flexibility

## FAQ

**What's the difference between factory, designer, and sourcing partners?**
Factories manufacture products, designers create designs and prototypes, sourcing partners handle procurement and quality inspections.

**How are performance metrics calculated?**
Metrics track partner reliability automatically from production order data. Calculated monthly: orders_completed, orders_on_time, defects, revenue, on_time_rate, defect_rate.

**Can I delete a partner?**
Partners are soft-deleted (status = inactive) to preserve audit trail. Cannot delete partners with active production orders.

**How do I assign portal access?**
Navigate to partner contacts, select contact, assign portal role and modules, system sends magic link email.

**What happens when I revoke portal access?**
Portal access disabled immediately, sessions invalidated, email notification sent, role/modules preserved for audit.
