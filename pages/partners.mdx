# Partner Management

## Overview

The Partner Management system provides comprehensive tools for managing relationships with external manufacturers, designers, sourcing agents, and other business partners throughout the product lifecycle. This integrated platform enables you to track partner capabilities, manage portal access, monitor performance metrics, coordinate communication, and maintain document compliance—all within a single unified interface.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Multi-Type Partner Support**: Manage three distinct partner types (factories, designers, sourcing agents) with specialized workflows, portal modules, and performance tracking tailored to each partner's role in the production ecosystem.

- **Comprehensive Contact Management**: Maintain unlimited contacts per partner with role-based flags (primary, QC, production, finance), employment tracking, department assignments, and employee lifecycle management from onboarding through termination.

- **Performance Analytics**: Track 12-month rolling metrics including orders completed, on-time delivery rates (0-100%), defect rates (0-100%), total revenue, and quality ratings (0-5 scale) with automated statistical aggregation and trend analysis.

- **Secure Portal Access**: Grant role-based portal access to partner contacts with granular module-level permissions (7 modules for factories, 5 for designers, 6 for sourcing), automatic email notifications, and instant session invalidation upon revocation.

- **Document Compliance Tracking**: Upload and track contracts, certifications, insurance policies, and technical specifications with issue dates, expiry dates, renewal reminders, and status management (active, archived, expired).

- **Capacity Planning**: Define production capacity (max units/month), lead time expectations (standard days), and minimum order requirements to prevent over-assignment, optimize workload distribution, and ensure realistic production scheduling.

- **Financial Integration**: Configure payment terms, currency preferences (default USD), and track revenue generation with integration to production invoicing for seamless financial operations and vendor management reporting.

- **Production System Integration**: Partners are directly linked to production orders with active order counts, assignment validation, deletion protection for partners with active work, and automated partner selection dropdowns based on status and type filtering.

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot Delete Partner**: Partner has active production orders. Complete or reassign orders first.

**Portal Access Not Working**: Verify portal_access_enabled = true, user_id is set, modules_allowed is not empty.

**Contact Not Receiving Email**: Check email address, verify Resend API configured, check spam folder.

**Performance Stats Missing**: Ensure partner_performance records exist, verify time range, check completed orders.

**Search Not Finding Partner**: Verify search term, check status filter, ensure partner exists.

## Tips & Tricks

- Use "pending_approval" status for vetting new partners
- Tag partners with "rush-capable" for urgent orders
- Set is_primary flag on main contact for notifications
- Monitor defect_rate trends to identify quality issues early
- Track actual lead times and update estimates
- Use specializations array for automated partner matching
- Review performance stats before contract renewals
- Set realistic minimum_order to balance profitability and flexibility

## FAQ

**What's the difference between factory, designer, and sourcing partners?**
Factories manufacture products, designers create designs and prototypes, sourcing partners handle procurement and quality inspections.

**How are performance metrics calculated?**
Metrics track partner reliability automatically from production order data. Calculated monthly: orders_completed, orders_on_time, defects, revenue, on_time_rate, defect_rate.

**Can I delete a partner?**
Partners are soft-deleted (status = inactive) to preserve audit trail. Cannot delete partners with active production orders.

**How do I assign portal access?**
Navigate to partner contacts, select contact, assign portal role and modules, system sends magic link email.

**What happens when I revoke portal access?**
Portal access disabled immediately, sessions invalidated, email notification sent, role/modules preserved for audit.
