# Design Management

## Overview

The Design Management system provides end-to-end tools for managing design projects from initial briefs through approvals, revisions, and final delivery. Collaborate with internal teams and external designers through integrated workflows, visual boards, and version-controlled deliverables.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Design Briefs**: Structured project requirements with client specifications, mood boards, brand guidelines, and creative direction.
- **Design Projects**: Full project lifecycle management with timelines, milestones, budgets, team assignments, and progress tracking.
- **Visual Boards**: Kanban-style organization boards for visualizing design workflow and collaboration across teams.
- **File Versioning**: Complete version control with design file uploads, revision history, and rollback capabilities.
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-stage review and approval process with stakeholder feedback, revision requests, and sign-offs.
- **Designer Portal**: External designer access for brief review, file submissions, feedback incorporation, and deliverable tracking.
- **Production Handoff**: Seamless transition from approved designs to production with technical specifications and manufacturing requirements.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Real-time comments, @mentions, file annotations, and activity feeds for team coordination.

**Timeline Visualization**: Gantt chart view of project timelines, milestone deadlines, designer assignments, and critical path identification.

**Capacity Planning**: Designer workload distribution, available capacity, project allocation, and resource utilization metrics.

**Approval Status**: Pending approvals requiring review, stuck projects awaiting feedback, overdue approvals, and approval bottlenecks.

**Design Metrics**: Average project duration, time-to-first-draft, revision cycles, approval rates, and on-time delivery percentage.

## Design Briefs

Design briefs capture project requirements, client specifications, creative direction, and constraints to guide designers from concept to completion.

### Creating Briefs

Navigate to Design > Briefs > New Brief. Required fields: project_name, client/project link, brief_description, deliverables, timeline, budget.

**Brief Components**:
- **Project Overview**: Scope, objectives, target audience, brand positioning
- **Deliverables**: Specific outputs required (sketches, CAD files, renderings, specs)
- **Creative Direction**: Style preferences, mood boards, inspiration references, brand guidelines
- **Constraints**: Budget limits, technical requirements, material restrictions, timeline deadlines
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable goals, approval checkpoints, quality standards

### Brief Status

- **Draft**: Brief being prepared, not yet assigned
- **Active**: Brief assigned to designer, work in progress
- **In Review**: Designer submitted initial concepts for review
- **Approved**: Brief completed, moving to production
- **On Hold**: Brief paused pending client decisions
- **Cancelled**: Brief cancelled before completion

### Brief-to-Project Workflow

Briefs automatically create linked design projects upon designer assignment. Project inherits brief timeline, budget, deliverables, and requirements for tracking.

## Design Projects

Design projects track the complete design lifecycle from brief assignment through final deliverable submission and production handoff.

### Project Management

**Project Details**: Name, description, client, assigned designer(s), brief link, timeline, budget, current status, progress percentage.

**Timeline Management**: Start date, target completion, milestone dates, actual completion tracking, delay alerts, deadline notifications.

**Team Assignment**: Lead designer, supporting designers, internal reviewers, client stakeholders, approval chain.

**Budget Tracking**: Total budget, hours logged, expenses, remaining budget, cost overruns, hourly rate calculations.

### Project Stages

1. **Brief Review**: Designer reviews brief, clarifies requirements, accepts project
2. **Concept Development**: Initial sketches, mood boards, concept presentations
3. **Design Refinement**: Detailed designs, CAD modeling, material selection
4. **Client Review**: Present designs, gather feedback, revision requests
5. **Revisions**: Incorporate feedback, iterate on designs
6. **Final Approval**: Stakeholder sign-off, design freeze
7. **Production Handoff**: Technical specs, manufacturing drawings, material lists
8. **Delivered**: Project complete, files archived

### Progress Tracking

Progress calculated based on: stage completion, milestone achievement, hours logged vs estimated, deliverables submitted, approvals obtained.

## Design Boards

Visual Kanban boards organize design tasks, files, and feedback for team collaboration and workflow visualization.

### Board Types

- **Project Boards**: One board per design project with columns for workflow stages
- **Team Boards**: Designer-specific boards showing all assigned tasks across projects
- **Review Boards**: Stakeholder boards for reviewing and approving designs

### Board Columns

Customizable columns typically include: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Revisions Needed, Approved, Ready for Production.

### Board Cards

Cards represent design tasks or files with: thumbnail preview, file name, designer, due date, status, comment count, attachment count.

**Card Actions**: Drag-and-drop between columns, add comments, attach files, assign reviewers, set due dates, mark approved.

## Design Files & Documents

Centralized repository for all design files with version control, access permissions, and organization by project/type.

### File Management

**Upload Files**: CAD files (DWG, DXF, STEP), 3D models (OBJ, STL, BLEND), renderings (PNG, JPG, TIFF), specifications (PDF, DOC), presentations (PPT, PDF).

**File Organization**: Organized by project > file type > version. Folder structure: `/projects/{project_id}/{file_type}/{filename_v{version}}`.

**Version Control**: Automatic versioning on upload (v1, v2, v3...), compare versions side-by-side, rollback to previous versions, version comments/notes.

**File Preview**: Thumbnail previews for images, PDF viewer for documents, 3D viewer for models (future enhancement).

### Access Control

- **Internal Team**: Full access to all design files
- **External Designers**: Access only to assigned project files via designer portal
- **Clients** (future): View-only access to approved deliverables

### File Types

- **Concept Sketches**: Early-stage hand sketches, digital sketches, inspiration images
- **CAD Drawings**: Technical drawings, assembly drawings, detail drawings
- **3D Models**: Product models, rendering models, manufacturing models
- **Renderings**: Photo-realistic renderings, material studies, lighting studies

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot Upload Design Files**: Check file size limits (50MB typical), verify supported file types, ensure project access permissions.

**Approval Stuck**: Identify bottleneck approver, send reminder notifications, escalate to project manager if overdue >3 days.

**Designer Portal Access Issues**: Verify designer portal access enabled, check email for magic link, resend portal access if needed.

**Version Control Not Working**: Ensure unique filename for new versions, check upload completion, verify version incremented automatically.

**Missing Production Drawings**: Verify final approval obtained, check if handoff initiated, contact designer for missing files.
