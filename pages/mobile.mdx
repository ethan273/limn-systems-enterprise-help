3. Tap **"Create Task"** button
4. Task created with default settings:
   - Priority: Medium
   - Assignee: You
   - Status: To Do
   - Due date: None

**Time to Create:** 5-10 seconds

### Advanced Task Creation

**Optional Fields:**

To access optional fields, tap the **"Show more options"** toggle (chevron down icon).

**Available Fields:**

**1. Priority** (Tap to select)
- Low (blue indicator)
- Medium (yellow indicator) - Default
- High (red indicator)

**2. Due Date** (Calendar picker)
- Tap calendar icon
- Select date from picker
- Time defaults to 11:59 PM
- Clear with "X" button

**3. Description** (Expandable text area)

8. Task created with all specified details

**Time to Create:** 15-30 seconds (with optional fields)

### Offline Task Capture

**How It Works:**

When offline (no internet connection), tasks are queued locally on your device and automatically synced when connection is restored.

**Offline Indicators:**

- Browser status bar shows "No connection"
- Toast notification: "Task queued for sync when online"
- Task appears in list with sync icon indicator

**Queue Management:**

- Tasks stored in IndexedDB (persistent browser storage)
- Queue survives browser restarts
- Maximum queue size: 50 tasks
- Auto-sync on connection restore (background)
- Manual sync available in settings

**Sync Process:**

1. Device regains internet connection
2. Background sync triggers automatically
3. Queued tasks uploaded to server in order
4. Server returns task IDs
5. Local task records updated with server IDs
6. Toast notification: "X tasks synced"

**Conflict Resolution:**

If a task was modified on another device while offline, the system uses "last write wins" strategy. Your offline changes take precedence.

## Best Practices

### Efficient Task Management

**1. Use Quick Capture for Speed**

- Enter only title for fastest capture
- Add details later from desktop
- Batch similar tasks together
- Use consistent naming (e.g., "Call: Client Name")

**2. Leverage Offline Mode**

- Create tasks immediately when thought occurs
- Don't wait for connection
- Trust queue to sync later
- Review synced tasks daily

**3. Filter Effectively**

- Start day viewing "To Do" tab
- Move tasks to "In Progress" when starting
- Review "Done" tab weekly for accountability
- Archive old completed tasks

**4. Prioritize Correctly**

- High: Urgent and important (do first)
- Medium: Important but not urgent (schedule)
- Low: Nice to have (do when time allows)
- Review priorities weekly

**5. Set Realistic Due Dates**

- Add due date only if truly deadline
- Don't set dates on every task (creates noise)
- Use calendar for time-specific tasks
- Buffer time for unexpected delays

### Mobile-Specific Tips

**Touch Targets:**

- All buttons minimum 44px (Apple guideline)
- Tap with thumb (one-handed use)
- Avoid accidental taps (spacing)
- Use haptic feedback (vibration) as confirmation

**Battery Conservation:**

- Close app when not in use (don't leave open)
- Disable background sync if not needed (Settings)
- Reduce screen brightness
- Use Wi-Fi instead of cellular when possible
- Disable notifications if excessive

**Performance Optimization:**

- Clear completed tasks regularly (reduces list size)
- Limit task list to 50-100 items (faster rendering)
- Avoid uploading large images (use desktop)
- Close other apps to free memory
- Update browser to latest version

**Security:**

- Lock device when not in use
- Don't save password in public devices
- Log out when finished
- Enable device encryption
- Use biometric auth if available (Face ID, Touch ID)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use mobile tasks without installing PWA?**

A: Yes! Visit the website in your mobile browser. However, installing as PWA provides better experience (faster, offline support, no browser UI).

---

**Q: What happens to offline tasks if I uninstall the app?**

A: Offline queue is stored in browser storage. If you uninstall PWA, the queue is deleted. Always sync before uninstalling. To preserve queue, reinstall immediately (may recover data).

---

**Q: Can I create tasks for other people?**

A: Not yet. Mobile interface only supports creating tasks for yourself. Use desktop interface to assign tasks to others. This feature is planned for future release.

---

**Q: Why can't I attach files from mobile?**

A: File upload is disabled on mobile to save data and storage. Use desktop interface to attach files. Mobile view allows viewing attachments uploaded from desktop.

---

**Q: Can I use mobile tasks on tablet?**

A: Yes! Tablets (iPad, Android tablets) are fully supported. Interface adapts to larger screens with wider layout. For tablets 10 inches or larger, consider using desktop interface for more features.

---

**Q: How do I switch between mobile and desktop interface?**

A: Mobile interface is at `/mobile/tasks`. Desktop interface is at `/dashboard` or `/tasks`. No automatic switching - manually navigate to desired interface. Bookmarks recommended.

---

**Q: Is my data secure on mobile?**

A: Yes. All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS). Offline queue encrypted on device using IndexedDB with encryption. Authentication required for all actions. Follow device security best practices (PIN, biometric auth).

---

**Q: Can I customize the mobile interface?**

A: Limited customization available:
- Sort order (Settings > Default Sort)
- Default priority (Settings > Default Priority)
- Auto-refresh interval (Settings > Auto-refresh)
- Notification preferences (Settings > Notifications)

More customization options planned for future releases.

---

**Q: What's the difference between mobile and desktop task interface?**

A: Mobile interface is simplified for speed and touch:
- Quick Capture (mobile only)
- Touch gestures (mobile only)
- Offline queue (mobile only)
- PWA installation (mobile only)
- Limited to your tasks only (desktop shows all)
- No bulk actions (desktop has bulk edit/delete)
- No advanced filters (desktop has 10+ filters)
- No task dependencies (desktop has task relationships)

Use mobile for quick capture and status updates. Use desktop for complex task management.
