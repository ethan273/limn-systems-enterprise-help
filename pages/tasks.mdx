# Tasks Management

The Tasks module provides a comprehensive project and work management system for organizing, tracking, and collaborating on tasks across your organization.

- **Organize by department** across Admin, Production, Design, and Sales teams
- **Set deadlines** with due date tracking and visual reminders
- **Collaborate** with comments, @mentions, and activity feeds
- **Attach files** to tasks for context and documentation
- **Link entities** to connect tasks with clients, projects, orders, and other records
- **Track time** with built-in time entry logging for accurate reporting

## Task Statuses and Workflows

### Available Statuses

The Tasks system uses a four-stage workflow:

#### 1. To Do
- **Icon:** Alert circle (⚠)
- **Meaning:** Task is ready to start but work hasn't begun
- **Use when:** Task is planned, requirements are clear, and ready for assignment
- **Next step:** Move to "In Progress" when work begins

#### 2. In Progress
- **Icon:** Clock (⏰)
- **Meaning:** Active work is currently being done on the task
- **Use when:** Someone is actively working to complete the task
- **Next step:** Move to "Completed" when finished or "Cancelled" if abandoned

#### 3. Completed
- **Icon:** Check circle (✓)
- **Meaning:** Task is finished and meets all requirements
- **Use when:** All work is done, deliverables are ready, and task can be closed
- **Result:** Task is marked complete with completion timestamp

#### 4. Cancelled
- **Icon:** X circle (✕)
- **Meaning:** Task is no longer needed or was abandoned
- **Use when:** Requirements changed, task is no longer relevant, or work was deprioritized
- **Result:** Task is closed without completion

### Status Workflow Examples

**Typical Workflow:**
```
To Do → In Progress → Completed
```

**Task No Longer Needed:**
```
To Do → Cancelled
```

**Work Interrupted:**
```
In Progress → Cancelled
```

## Troubleshooting

### Task Not Appearing

**Problem:** Created task doesn't show in list

**Solutions:**
1. Check active filters - clear all filters to see all tasks
2. Verify visibility setting - task may be private
3. Check department filter - task may be in different department
4. Refresh page - force reload to fetch latest data
5. Check archive status - archived tasks hidden by default

### Cannot Change Status

**Problem:** Status dropdown disabled or not saving

**Solutions:**
1. Check permissions - ensure you have edit access
2. Verify task not archived - archived tasks read-only
3. Check dependencies - may need to complete prerequisites
4. Try refreshing page - clear stale cache
5. Contact admin if permissions issue

### File Upload Failing

**Problem:** Attachment won't upload

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size - must be under 50MB
2. Verify file type - some extensions blocked
3. Check internet connection - upload may timeout
4. Try smaller file - compress if possible
5. Use external link - for very large files

### Notifications Not Received

**Problem:** Missing assignment or mention notifications

**Solutions:**
1. Check notification settings - verify email notifications enabled
2. Check spam folder - notifications may be filtered
3. Verify email address - ensure profile email correct
4. Check "Do Not Disturb" - may be temporarily disabled
5. Contact admin - server issues possible

### Dependency Warning

**Problem:** Cannot complete task due to dependency

**Solutions:**
1. View Dependencies tab - identify blocking tasks
2. Check prerequisite status - verify dependencies complete
3. Contact blocking task assignees - ask for ETA
4. Request dependency removal - if no longer needed
5. Create workaround - if urgent and unblock not possible

### Time Entry Error

**Problem:** Cannot save time entry

**Solutions:**
1. Check time format - ensure valid start/end times
2. Verify end after start - end time must be later
3. Check duration - if manual, must be positive number
4. Try different browser - compatibility issue possible
5. Contact support - database issue possible

### Bulk Operation Failed

**Problem:** Bulk status update or archive failed

**Solutions:**
1. Check selection - verify tasks selected
2. Reduce batch size - try smaller groups
3. Verify permissions - must have edit access to all
4. Check for archived - cannot bulk edit archived tasks
5. Try individual updates - isolate problem task

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Can I assign a task to multiple people?**
A: Yes, select multiple users in the "Assigned To" field. All assignees receive notifications and see the task in their "My Tasks" view.

**Q: What's the difference between assigned users and watchers?**
A: Assigned users are responsible for completing the task. Watchers receive notifications but aren't responsible. Use watchers for managers, stakeholders, or interested parties.

**Q: Can I recover a deleted task?**
A: Deleted tasks cannot be recovered. Use the "Cancelled" status instead of deletion for tasks you may need to reference later. Contact support immediately if critical task was deleted.

**Q: How do I hide completed tasks?**
A: Use the status filter and deselect "Completed". Completed tasks are shown by default but can be filtered out. Consider archiving old completed tasks for cleaner lists.

**Q: Can I create subtasks?**
A: While there's no formal subtask feature, use task dependencies and linking to create parent-child relationships. Alternatively, use checklist items in task descriptions.

### Permissions

**Q: Who can see my private tasks?**
A: Private tasks are visible only to the creator, assigned users, and system administrators. They don't appear in department or company-wide views.

**Q: Can I edit someone else's task?**
A: Yes, if you have appropriate permissions. Generally, all team members can edit tasks in their department. Admins can edit all tasks.

**Q: Who receives notifications when I comment?**
A: All assigned users, watchers, @mentioned users, and the task creator receive comment notifications (unless they've opted out).

### Workflow

**Q: Can I create custom task statuses?**
A: No, the four standard statuses (To Do, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled) are fixed. Use tags or task types for custom categorization.

**Q: Should I use tags or task types?**
A: Use task types for broad categories (e.g., "Bug", "Feature", "Documentation") and tags for flexible filtering (e.g., "urgent", "client-request", "Q4-2024").

**Q: How do I handle recurring tasks?**
A: Use templates for consistent recurring work. Create a new task from the template each time. Automation rules can create tasks automatically based on triggers (admin configuration).

### Time Tracking

**Q: Is time tracking mandatory?**
A: Time tracking is optional but recommended. It helps with project estimation, billing, and workload planning. Your organization's policy may require it.

**Q: Can I edit time entries after saving?**
A: Yes, click "Edit" on any time entry to modify times or descriptions. Changes are logged in the activity feed.

**Q: How accurate do time estimates need to be?**
A: Estimates are planning tools, not commitments. Aim for reasonable accuracy. Review actual vs. estimated hours over time to improve estimation skills.

### Reporting

**Q: Can I export task lists?**
A: Yes, use the export button to download task lists as CSV or Excel files. Filters and sort order are applied to exports.

**Q: How do I see my team's workload?**
A: Filter by department and view assigned tasks. Use the Kanban board for visual overview. Managers have access to team workload reports.

**Q: Where can I see task metrics?**
A: The tasks dashboard shows key metrics including completion rates, average resolution time, tasks by status, and overdue tasks. Custom reports available to admins.

### Best Practices

**Q: How many tasks should I have active at once?**
A: Limit to 3-5 active tasks per person to maintain focus. More than 10 active tasks indicates work needs to be prioritized or redistributed.

**Q: When should I use high priority?**
A: Reserve high priority for urgent, time-sensitive, or blocking tasks. If everything is high priority, nothing is. Aim for less than 20% high-priority tasks.

**Q: How long should tasks remain open?**
A: Most tasks should complete within 1-2 weeks. Tasks open longer than 30 days should be reviewed - may need to be broken down, deprioritized, or cancelled.

**Q: Should I update task descriptions or comment?**
A: Use comments for progress updates, questions, and discussions. Edit descriptions only to clarify requirements or correct errors. Comments preserve timeline better.
