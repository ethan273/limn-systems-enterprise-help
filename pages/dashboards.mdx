**Q: Why is my revenue different on different dashboards?**

A: Different dashboards may show different revenue calculations:
- **Executive:** Total revenue (all sources)
- **Financial:** Collected revenue (cash basis)
- **Analytics:** Order revenue (may include pending)

Always check the date range and metric definition.

**Q: How is "on-time" calculated?**

A:
- **Projects:** Completed by end_date
- **Deliveries:** Delivered by/before promised_date
- **Production:** Completed by scheduled_completion_date

**Q: What's the difference between "invoiced" and "revenue"?**

A:
- **Invoiced:** Amount billed (may not be paid yet)
- **Revenue:** Amount collected (cash received)
- **A/R (Accounts Receivable):** Invoiced but not yet paid

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Dashboard shows "No data available" - why?**

A: Possible reasons:
- Date range has no activity (try expanding range)
- New account with no historical data
- Permissions prevent seeing data
- Data filters excluding all results

**Q: Charts are empty but metrics show numbers - what's wrong?**

A: Usually a browser rendering issue:
1. Try different browser
2. Clear cache and refresh
3. Disable browser extensions
4. Update browser to latest version

**Q: Export to PDF shows partial data - how to fix?**

A:
1. Scroll to top of dashboard before exporting
2. Wait for all charts to fully load
3. Try shorter date range (less data = faster export)
4. Use Chrome for most reliable PDF generation

**Q: Dashboard performance is slow - how to improve?**

A:
- Use shorter date ranges (7d or 30d instead of All)
- Close other browser tabs
- Check internet connection speed
- Clear browser cache
- Restart browser

### Advanced Usage

**Q: Can I schedule automated dashboard reports?**

A: Automated reporting is planned for a future release. Currently, you can manually export PDFs and email them on your desired schedule.

**Q: Can I embed dashboards in other tools?**

A: Dashboard embedding is not currently supported. You can share screenshots or PDF exports.

**Q: How do I compare my performance to industry benchmarks?**

A: Benchmarking data is not built-in. You can export your metrics and compare manually to industry data from your sources.

**Q: Can I export raw data for custom analysis?**

A: Yes! Navigate to the detail pages (Orders, Projects, etc.) and use the export features to get CSV data for custom analysis in Excel or other tools.

**Q: How far back does historical data go?**

A: Historical data goes back to your account creation date or data migration date. There's no time limit on data retention.
