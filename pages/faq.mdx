**Effective Permissions:**

- Super admin has ALL permissions automatically

**Learn More:** [RBAC System](/rbac)

### I can't access a feature. Why?

**Common Reasons:**

**1. Insufficient Permissions**
- Your role doesn't include required permissions
- Feature restricted to specific roles (e.g., QuickBooks sync for finance only)
- **Solution:** Contact your administrator to request access

**2. Customer-Scoped Data**
- You're trying to access data for a customer you're not assigned to
- Multi-tenant isolation prevents cross-customer access
- **Solution:** Ask administrator to assign you to that customer

**3. Portal User Limitation**
- Portal users can only access their specific portal
- Cannot access internal admin features
- **Solution:** This is intentional - contact your Limn Systems representative

**4. Feature Flag Disabled**
- Feature not yet enabled for your organization
- Rolling deployments may not include all features immediately
- **Solution:** Contact support to check feature flag status

**5. Browser/Network Issue**
- Page failed to load properly
- Network connectivity problem
- **Solution:** Refresh page (Cmd/Ctrl+R), clear cache, check network

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check your assigned roles (User Profile > Roles & Permissions)
2. Verify feature exists in navigation (may be role-dependent)
3. Try accessing from different browser/device
4. Contact administrator if permissions issue

**Learn More:** [RBAC System](/rbac), [Troubleshooting](/global-features#troubleshooting)

### Can I have multiple roles?

**Yes**, users can have multiple roles simultaneously.

**Common Multi-Role Scenarios:**
- Employee + Sales (general employee with sales permissions)
- Sales + Marketing (account managers who run email campaigns)
- Production_Manager + QC_Internal (production managers who perform inspections)
- Admin + Sales (sales director with administrative access)

**Permission Calculation:**
- Permissions are **cumulative** (union of all role permissions)
- If Role A grants "read" and Role B grants "write", user has both
- User-specific permissions override role permissions

**Super Admin Exception:**
- Super admin already has all permissions
- Assigning additional roles has no effect

**Assigning Multiple Roles:**
1. Navigate to Administration > Users
2. Select user
3. Go to "Roles" tab
4. Click "Assign Role" for each role
5. User immediately receives combined permissions

**Learn More:** [RBAC System](/rbac)

### How do I request additional permissions?

**For Internal Employees:**
1. Identify specific permission needed (e.g., "create_orders")
2. Message #support Slack channel with:
   - Your name and email
   - Permission or feature you need access to
   - Business justification
3. Administrator will review and approve/deny
4. Permissions take effect immediately upon approval

**For External Portal Users:**
- Contact your Limn Systems representative
- Explain what access you need
- They will coordinate with internal administrators

**Administrator Approval Process:**
1. Verify requester's identity
2. Confirm business need aligns with role
3. Check if role assignment is more appropriate than individual permission
4. Grant permission (logged in audit trail)
5. Notify requester

**Audit Trail:**
- All permission grants logged with: who, when, what, why
- Admins can review permission history
- SOC 2 compliance requirement

## Integration Questions

### How does the Google Workspace integration work?

**Google Workspace Integration Overview:**

Limn Systems Enterprise uses **Google OAuth SSO** for employee authentication.

**Employee Login Flow:**
1. Employee visits https://app.limn.us.com
2. Clicks "Sign in with Google"
3. Redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
4. Employee authorizes with @limn.us.com Google account
5. Google returns access token
6. System verifies email domain = "@limn.us.com"
7. System creates/updates user record
8. System checks admin allowlist for auto-provisioning
9. Session established (30-day cookie if "Remember Me" checked)

**Admin Allowlist Auto-Provisioning:**
- Certain email addresses auto-granted admin privileges on first login
- Table: `admin_allowlist` (email, role, granted_by, granted_at)
- Example: ethan@limn.us.com auto-granted super_admin role

**Domain Restriction:**
- Only @limn.us.com email addresses allowed for employee login
- Other domains rejected at OAuth step
- Portal users (external) use magic links, not Google SSO

**OAuth Scopes Requested:**
- `email` - Read email address
- `profile` - Read name and profile picture
- `openid` - Verify identity

**Benefits:**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) - no separate password
- Leverages existing Google security (MFA, account recovery)
- Auto-sync profile picture from Google account
- Simplified onboarding for new employees

**Security:**
- OAuth tokens stored encrypted
- Access tokens expire after 1 hour (auto-refresh)
- Refresh tokens expire after 30 days
- Manual logout revokes all tokens

**Disconnecting Google Account:**
- Navigate to User Menu > Settings > Security
- Click "Disconnect Google Account"
- Confirmation dialog (requires admin approval)
- After disconnect: account converted to email/password authentication

### Data isn't syncing. How do I fix it?

**Sync Issues Troubleshooting:**

**Step 1: Check Network Connection**
- Verify internet connected
- Check if firewall blocking API requests
- Try loading other pages in app

**Step 2: Check Offline Banner**
- If "Offline" banner visible (top of page): device offline
- Wait for connection to restore
- Banner changes to "Syncing..." when online

**Step 3: Manual Sync (If Supported)**
- Some modules have "Refresh" button (circular arrow icon)
- Click to force sync

**Step 4: Check Integration Status**

**QuickBooks Sync Issues:**
1. Navigate to Finance > QuickBooks Integration
2. Check last sync time
3. If sync failed: view error message
4. Click "Retry Sync" button
5. If error persists: disconnect and reconnect QuickBooks

**SEKO WMS Sync Issues:**
1. Navigate to Shipping module
2. Check shipment tracking status
3. If stale: click "Refresh Tracking"
4. SEKO webhook syncs every 2 hours automatically

**Step 5: Clear Browser Cache**
- Old cached data may be displaying
- Clear cache (see "Page won't load" troubleshooting above)
- Refresh page

**Step 6: Check Browser Console**
- Press F12, go to Console tab
- Look for API errors (red messages)
- Common errors:
  - 401 Unauthorized - Session expired, log out and log back in
  - 403 Forbidden - Permission denied
  - 500 Internal Server Error - Server issue, contact support
  - Network Error - Internet connection issue

**Step 7: Contact Support**
- Email support@limn.us.com
- Include:
  - What data isn't syncing (order, invoice, shipment, etc.)
  - Record ID (if applicable)
  - When sync last worked (if known)
  - Screenshot of error (if visible)

**Sync Indicators:**
- **Green checkmark** - Data synced successfully
- **Spinning icon** - Sync in progress
- **Red X** - Sync failed (hover for error message)
- **Gray clock** - Scheduled sync pending

### My browser is slow. How can I improve performance?

**Performance Optimization:**

**Step 1: Check Browser Version**
- Use latest browser version (Chrome 120+, Firefox 120+, Safari 17+, Edge 120+)
- Outdated browsers may have performance issues
- Update browser: Help > About [Browser Name]

**Step 2: Close Unused Tabs**
- Each tab consumes memory
- Close tabs not actively using
- Keep Limn Systems tab pinned for quick access

**Step 3: Clear Browser Cache**
- Accumulated cache may slow down browser
- Clear cache (see troubleshooting above)
- Restart browser after clearing

**Step 4: Disable Unnecessary Extensions**
- Extensions consume memory and CPU
- Disable extensions not needed for work
- Keep essential security extensions (antivirus, VPN if required)

**Step 5: Check System Resources**

**macOS:**
- Open Activity Monitor (Cmd+Space, type "Activity Monitor")
- Check CPU and Memory tabs
- If browser using >80% CPU or memory: close other apps

**Windows:**
- Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
- Check Processes tab
- If browser using >80% CPU or memory: close other apps

**Step 6: Optimize Dashboard Usage**
- Dashboards with many widgets may be slow
- Hide unused widgets (Dashboard > Edit Mode)
- Use shorter date ranges (last 7 days vs. last year)

**Step 7: Use Pagination**
- Don't load all 10,000 orders at once
- Use filters to narrow results
- Use pagination controls (Next/Previous)

**Step 8: Upgrade Hardware (If Possible)**
- Minimum recommended specs:
  - 8 GB RAM
  - Dual-core processor (2 GHz+)
  - SSD (solid-state drive)
- Limn Systems works on lower specs but may be slower

**Step 9: Use Desktop App (PWA)**
- Desktop PWA may perform better than browser tab
- Install PWA (see installation instructions above)
- Dedicated window, optimized resource usage

**Step 10: Contact IT Support**
- If slowness persists: IT issue (not app issue)
- Contact your IT department
- Possible causes:
  - Network bandwidth throttling
  - Corporate firewall slowing API requests
  - VPN latency
